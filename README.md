## Getting Started

### For Coding Challenges:
1. Navigate to the [python_challenges/](python_challenges/) directory
2. Choose either [intermediate/](python_challenges/intermediate/) or [senior/](python_challenges/senior/) based on your skill level
3. Select a challenge file and follow the instructions
4. Implement your solution and run the test cases

### For 60-Day Challenge:
1. Navigate to the [30-Day-Senior-Python-Challenge/](python-%20challenge%20project/30-Day-Senior-Python-Challenge/) directory
2. Follow the daily challenges sequentially for best learning progression
3. Use the [progress.md](python-%20challenge%20project/30-Day-Senior-Python-Challenge/progress.md) file to track your completion
4. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Both collections provide comprehensive preparation for senior-level Python positions and technical interviews.
