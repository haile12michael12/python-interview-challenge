# day32_custom_task_queue: [Gear] Custom Task Queue Engine (like Celery)

## Challenge
Build a custom task queue engine similar to Celery that can handle distributed task processing with multiple workers, task persistence, and result retrieval.

## What It Tests
Threading, job state persistence

## Requirements
- Implement a task queue system with producer-consumer pattern
- Support multiple worker processes
- Persist tasks to a backend storage (Redis, database, etc.)
- Handle task retries and failure cases
- Provide APIs for task submission and result retrieval
- Support task priorities and scheduling
- Implement proper concurrency controls

## Implementation Tips
- Use threading or multiprocessing for worker processes
- Implement a reliable task broker (Redis, RabbitMQ, or custom)
- Design task serialization/deserialization mechanisms
- Handle worker failures and task requeuing
- Implement result storage and retrieval
- Add monitoring and logging capabilities
- Consider using existing libraries as inspiration but implement from scratch

## Testing
- Test task submission and execution
- Verify worker scaling and load distribution
- Test failure scenarios and retries
- Validate task persistence across system restarts
- Check result retrieval and timeout handling
- Benchmark performance with concurrent tasks
