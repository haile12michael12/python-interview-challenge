# day48_ml_model_deployment: [Robot] ML Model Deployment Pipeline

## Challenge
Create a complete pipeline for deploying machine learning models with versioning, A/B testing, and monitoring capabilities.

## What It Tests
Model serving, versioning, A/B testing

## Requirements
- Implement a model registry for versioning and management
- Create deployment endpoints with load balancing
- Implement A/B testing framework for model comparison
- Add monitoring for model performance and data drift
- Include rollback mechanisms for failed deployments
- Provide API documentation and usage examples

## Implementation Tips
1. Use a model registry like MLflow or custom solution for versioning
2. Implement RESTful APIs for model inference
3. Add request/response logging for monitoring
4. Implement canary deployments for A/B testing
5. Use feature stores for consistent feature engineering
6. Add health checks and performance metrics

## Testing
Create test cases for:
- Model loading and inference
- Version switching and rollback
- A/B testing traffic splitting
- Performance monitoring and alerts
- Error handling and edge cases
- Scalability under load
