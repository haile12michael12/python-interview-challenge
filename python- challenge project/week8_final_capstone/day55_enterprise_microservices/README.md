# day55_enterprise_microservices: [Office] Enterprise Microservices Suite

## Challenge
Design and implement a suite of microservices that work together to form an enterprise-grade application with proper service discovery, communication, and resilience patterns.

## What It Tests
Distributed architecture, service mesh

## Requirements
- Create multiple independent services with well-defined APIs
- Implement service discovery and registration
- Add inter-service communication with proper error handling
- Include circuit breaker and retry patterns
- Implement distributed tracing and logging
- Add authentication and authorization between services
- Provide service mesh capabilities (optional)

## Implementation Tips
1. Use REST or gRPC for service communication
2. Implement service registry (Consul, Eureka, or custom)
3. Add proper logging and monitoring for each service
4. Implement circuit breaker pattern for resilience
5. Use message queues for asynchronous communication
6. Add health checks and readiness probes
7. Implement proper error handling and fallback mechanisms

## Testing
Create test cases for:
- Service registration and discovery
- Inter-service communication
- Failure scenarios and circuit breaker activation
- Load balancing and scaling
- Security and authentication between services
- Performance under concurrent requests
