# Day 60: Complete System Architecture

## Challenge
Design and document a complete system architecture for a large-scale application that incorporates all concepts learned throughout the challenge.

## Requirements
- Create a comprehensive architecture diagram
- Document all components and their interactions
- Include deployment strategies and infrastructure
- Specify monitoring, logging, and alerting approaches
- Address security considerations and compliance
- Provide scaling and performance optimization plans
- Include disaster recovery and backup strategies

## What It Tests
- End-to-end system design capabilities
- Integration of multiple technologies and concepts
- Documentation and communication skills
- Scalability and reliability planning
- Security and compliance awareness
- Operational excellence and DevOps practices

## Implementation Tips
1. Use architectural patterns like microservices, event-driven, or serverless
2. Consider data flow and storage solutions
3. Plan for different environments (dev, staging, prod)
4. Include observability and monitoring from the start
5. Address security at every layer
6. Plan for failure scenarios and recovery
7. Consider cost optimization and resource utilization

## Deliverables
- Architecture diagram (C4 model preferred)
- Component documentation
- Deployment and infrastructure plan
- Monitoring and alerting strategy
- Security and compliance documentation
- Scaling and performance plans
- Operational procedures and runbooks
